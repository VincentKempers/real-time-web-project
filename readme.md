# real-time-web-project

This is going to be an app that makes meeting up easier. To figure out what or which is the best for both users.

## how should this work.

You can create a room and invite your friends. When the friends join the room one of them (the person who created the room) can pin point a location. When the user have pinpointed a location the server suggests some locations around that point. When the user "locks in" a location the users will see the point. When the users reach a point the users can hit i'm there. So the other users know he/she is already there so they can see him/her.
